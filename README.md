### Clustering build logs to analyse common build issues

# With Docker

You can build and run the clustering using docker. However, this can lead to much slower latency, due to the docker not being able to use the accelerations of Metal on Mac. You can follow the instructions in the README in the folder `ClusteringWithDocker` but first make sure to `cd` into the folder.

# Without Docker

You can run the same analysis without docker, by following the README instructions in the folder `Clustering`, but first make sure to `cd` into the folder.
